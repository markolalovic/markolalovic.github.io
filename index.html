        Welcome! I'm Marko. My research interests touch several areas of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics. Currently, my focus is on developing more effective algorithms with provable guarantees. I am also interested in developing applications of machine learning and designing AI systems. <br/>I completed my MS degree in Industrial Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html">University of Hamburg</a>, Germany. My MS thesis was on Exact Algorithms for Dense Maximum Cut supervised by <a href="https://www.tuhh.de/algo/research/mnich">Prof Matthias Mnich</a> at the <a href="https://www.tuhh.de/algo/homepage">Institute for Algorithms and Complexity</a>, TUHH. Before that, I was studying for my MS in Applied Statistics and did my BS in Mathematics and Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.uni-lj.si/en/university">University of Ljubljana</a>, Slovenia. <br/> 
        I worked on applications of machine learning in many fields including biotechnology, medicine and fraud prevention. My experience includes building, evaluating, and deploying large-scale models. Prior to that, I was a student researcher at two departments at <a href="https://www.ijs.si/ijsw/JSI">Jozef Stefan Institute</a> where I worked on applying deep learning to robotics and on performance evaluation of machine learning algorithms.
